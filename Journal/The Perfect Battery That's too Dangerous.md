One engineering problem that really fascinates me is the story of the so-called "perfect" battery, not because it's not solved, we actually got the perfect battery everyone (scientist, researchers, engineers) were looking for, only for it to have huge shortcomings. Thus, its not really a perfect battery. 
Lithium-metal battery had one thing going for it which is high energy density, it could hold large amount of energy in a small package, exactly what engineers and scientist thought would be the trait of the perfect battery, except there was a huge flaw. Every time the battery was charged, thin needles like crystals called dendrites began to grow inside, eventually they would pierce through the negative and positive separator that kept the sides apart. The result wasn't just a broken, leaky battery - it would catch fire and even explode.Thus, this battery that excited a lot of professionals was declared to be too dangerous to unleash on the public.
What haunts me about this problem is how close we got to having a perfect battery, a revolutionary technology that would have changed the face of technology as we know it today. Engineers had to completely rethink the design, replacing the unstable lithium metal with graphite, this new battery was called lithium-ion battery, the battery we use in our every day products. Though good it's not exactly as energy dense as lithium metal battery, which makes me rethink the ceiling of technological advancement.
