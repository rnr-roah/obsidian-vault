(sig figs) we do measurements in science

*Rules to determine sig. figs.*

1) Any of the digits of the number beginning with the digits farthest to the right i.e. either not zero or i.e. zero but is considered to be exact are significant.
2) Sig. figs. are use to report a value measured or calculate to the correct number of decimal place or digit that will reflect the precision of the value
3) The no. of sig figs depends on measurement 

*How to count sig. figs.*

1) All non-zero digits are sig. figs..
		example: 225 -> 3 sig figs
				225.8 -> 4 sig. figs.
2) All zero digits that are found between non-zero are significant.
			example :  207 -> 3 sig figs
					2007 -> 4 sig figs
3) Leading zeros (to the left of the first non-zero digit) are not significant.
			example:  ==0.00==85 ->2 sig figs
                    highlighted:  placeholders (not significant)
4) Trailing zeros for a whole number that ends with a decimal point are significant.
			example:  320. -> 3sig figs
					320 -> 2 sig figs
					50 -> 1 sig figs
5) Trailing zeros to the right of decimal are significant.
			example:  12.000  -> 5 sig figs
6) *Exact Numbers* are assumed to have infinite sig. figs.
    *Irrational Numbers* are also assumed to have infinite sig figs
    *examples* :
	    1) Exact numbers: used or defined in a defining expression.
			    ==1== meter ===100== cm
			    highlighted : exact numbers - infinite sig figs.
		2)  Irrational numbers: these are real numbers that cannot be expressed as ratio of integers.
      *Any number i.e. not exact is called inexact*
